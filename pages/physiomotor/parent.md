# Physiomotor responses
Let's analyse the neurophysiological and motor data as "emotional responses" rather than "EEG artefacts".

## Possible response types
- [ ] vEOG: blink rates
- [ ] hEOG: Mouse-cursor-locked horizontal EOG? meaningless?
- [ ] facial EMG: smiling and frowning?
- [ ] SCR: event-related phasic responses
- [ ] RESP: breathing rate variability?
- [ ] PULSE: heart rate variability?
- [ ] ACC: frequency-tagging: magnitude; or phase-locking.

## TODOs
- [ ] Neurokit2 preprocessing
- [ ] Motor-beat coherence
