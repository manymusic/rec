## Current recordings

![recordings](figs/run-prog.png)
<br><small>Each box represents a run. *GREY*: Yet to be done. *RED*: With major issues like a wrong song was played and so on. Needs to be rerun. *YELLOW*: With minor issues like the StimTrak was turned off. No need to rerun. *GREEN*: All good (but possibly with "normal" artefacts.</small>

## Average channel goodness percentages

![recordings](figs/avg-isgood.png)
<br><small>Percentages of "GOOD" runs for each channel are plotted. *EEG*: "BAD" channels were identified by EEGLAB/CLEAN_ARTIFACTS(). *EXG*: "BAD" cahnnels were identified by value ranges (and expected peak frequencies for RESP & PULSE).</small>
